### Freelance Vendor Listing Service
Proposal By: Jaime Cayetano, Julia Yang

### What and why?
Street vendors are an integral part of New York City’s economic and cultural dynamic, and of the real New York. Many street vendors go unnoticed and are taken for granted simply because they sell on the street and don’t have a proper storefront from which they can sell their products. We would like to build a phone application that would allow street vendors - whether it be street stands, farmers markets stands, or food trucks - to have complete control over the reach that their business has in the New York City area. By using a mobile application, not only will street vendors be able to easily stay in touch with clientele but they will also be able to advertise their businesses with ease, increasing their sales.  

### For whom?
This will be an application that will serve all New Yorkers, especially street vendors, who are extremely hardworking and sometimes make very little money. It is worth noting that not all street vendors sell food and street vendors usually don’t show up on browser searches. The average consumer will also be benefiting from this application since they will be able to access information about different street vendors they wouldn’t otherwise hear of and subsequently have more buying options.

### How?
If a user registers as a street vendor, they have different options. Street vendors will be able to create posts in which they can include their business hours and most importantly, their exact location for a said day. This way, customers can find out when and where they can go to a specific stand. Street vendors will also be able to make posts about what it is that they specifically sell and their price rates. If street vendors allow it, clients will be able to place orders in advance for certain items. If a user registers as a client (not a street vendor), they will be able to search for vendors that sell specific items by searching an item in a search bar.

### Scope
While the app will need to contain several components on both the client and vendor side, we can use similar, existing apps and open-source codebases to use as examples. For example, Square, or Craigslist-like clones that have extensive repositories on Github. At the same time, this project has room for more sophisticated features, such as different ways to sort and filter, a map feature, DMs, or translation.
